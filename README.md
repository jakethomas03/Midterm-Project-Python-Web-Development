# Midterm Project Python Web Development

## This is my midterm project for my Python Web Development class. It is a web application that allows you to track and rate movies that you watch. 

For this project, we were instructed to create create a simple web application using FastAPI framework and HTML/JavaScript/CSS. The web application includes SCRUD (search, create, read, update, and delete) functionality and all of the data is stored in the in-memory database (a list). 

### Front-End Files  
- **`index.html`** – The core HTML file that structures the web page and includes form inputs, buttons, and the movie list display.  
- **`styles.css`** – Defines the styling of the web application, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.  
- **`main.js`** – The main JavaScript file that handles dynamic interactions, API calls, movie list updates, search functionality, and event listeners.  

I also used a favicon icon for the tab image as seen here: 
<img width="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b1e5e3c-73b1-4ce3-97b5-5429bf080f42" />

### Back-End Files 
- **`main.py`** – The entry point of the application. It initializes the server and connects different components.  
- **`movie.py`** – Contains API routes and logic related to movie operations such as adding, editing, and deleting movies.  
- **`model.py`** – Defines the database schema and handles interactions with the database.  

The following video shows the resulting web application in action:
